  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>This application is designed to ease the reservation process for venues and lounges around the city</p>
  <h3>Technologies</h3>

  <p>Crafted using some of the latest technologies available. The tags listed at the top of the page give a broad list of technologies.  Due to my new found joy of server side javascript development - this was my first big venture using nodejs for an application.</p>

  <h4>Web Application</h4>
  <p>For the application itself I was able to take advantage of the quick development process of angular, testing framework of karma, and the build tools of grunt and bower.</p>

  <h4>Server-side Persistence</h4>
  <p>For the server-side/persistence of the application data, I made use of nodejs for its familiarity, mongodb for its document based storage, and heroku as my deployment platform.  I wouldn't say I am an expert with these technologies, but I have gained much experience while developing this process; I am actively working on integrating Mocha as my CI testing framework for server-side code.</p>

  <h4>Mobile Deployment</h4>
  <p>Lastly I was able to use phonegap to allow my application to be pushed to native mobile clients. phonegap fits well with angularjs, and my workflow described above, which is the primary reason I chose to support this platform as well.</p>
