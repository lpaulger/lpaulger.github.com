I've spent the last few months building a simple cribbage card game app entirely in javascript.

I decided to do this for one main reason, improving my native javascript development skills (familiarizing myself with the javascript api, browser specificity, how to avoid jquery), but I learned much more along the way.

Here's a quick summary of the things I've learned throughout these past few months that I will be able to take with me into my future projects:

* [Development cycle](#DevelopmentCycle)
* [Javascript skills](#JavascriptSkills)
* [Abstract development](#AbstractDevelopment)
